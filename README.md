## Architecture

- **Amazon S3**: Uploads batch of 100 customer review CSV files
- **AWS Lambda**: Triggered by S3 `ObjectCreated` event
- **Amazon Comprehend**: Performs sentiment and entity detection on each review
- **S3**: Stores the results in a designated output folder
- **Amazon QuickSight**: Visualizes sentiment distribution and entity frequency

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Upload a CSV file to `s3://input-bucket/reviews.csv`
2. An S3 event triggers a Lambda function written in Python
3. Lambda reads the CSV, calls Amazon Comprehend for analysis
4. Processed results are saved to `s3://output-bucket/results/`
5. QuickSight dashboard to connect to S3 folder and visualize the new data
